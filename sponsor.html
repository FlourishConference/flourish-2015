        <h1>Sponsor Flourish</h1>

        <p>
            For eight years, Flourish has been Chicago&rsquo;s free open source
            conference. Flourish can only afford to create an amazing conference,
            and bring together the vibrant Chicago open source community through
            your contributions. As a sponsor, you'll be able to introduce yourself
            to the talent of the community while also becoming a member of the
            community.
        </p>

        <p>
            What follows is a guide of what you can expect from your sponsorship.
            Any questions, concerns, potential substitutions can be sent to the
